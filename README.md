PyBad-Translator
================

Python implementation of a "bad translator" using the [google-translate-python](https://github.com/terryyin/google-translate-python/) project.


## Overview
  PyBad-Translator allows you to translate a string of text through multiple languages and recive a result.
  
## Credits
  PyBad-Translator is made by Blade Nelson([@powderblock](https://github.com/powderblock)).
  
It uses the [google-translate-python](https://github.com/terryyin/google-translate-python/) project to actually process translation requests. 

The [Google Web Interface and Search Language Codes](https://sites.google.com/site/tomihasa/google-language-codes) project was a _big_ help when it came to the google translate languages.
